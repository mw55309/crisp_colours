# Crisp Colours
Also known as chips in strange countries.  A global standard for crisp/chip packaging colours.

* Light blue - Salt 'n' vingear
* Blue - paprika
* Green - Cheese 'n' onion
* Brown - Beef (possibly with onion)
* Yellow - Chicken
* Maroon - Gammon
* Red - tomato sauce
* White - salt 'n' shake
* Purple - Worcester sauce

Scampi fries, doritos (and variants) and any kind of corn product _are not crisps_ therefore do not count.
