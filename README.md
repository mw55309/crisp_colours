# Potato Chip Colours
Also known as crisps in strange countries.  A global standard for crisp/chip packaging colours.

* Blue - Original (aka sea salt)
* Light blue - Sour cream & onion (or chives)
* Green - Chicken
* Brown - Barbeque
* Yellow - Cheese
* Purple - Salt & vinegar
* Lime green - Light 'n' tangy

Scampi fries, doritos (and variants) and any kind of corn product _are not chips_ therefore do not count.
